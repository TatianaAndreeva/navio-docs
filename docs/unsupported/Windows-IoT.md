#Windows IoT Downloads

Microsoft provide the master image of "Windows 10 IoT Core" for the Raspberry Pi 2 here:

For the rest of the software, later you will be able to download either a pre-prepared image including the drivers and apps, or add the software to an existing installation. Although Windows 10 is "finished" the IoT embedded environment is still in "preview" stage.

It remains to be seen what Microsoft will provide for provisioning and deployment of end user applications, and if there will be any other editions than "core". It's very likely to have a Windows Store style one-click installation, or at least we will be able to provide manual download links which you can easily "side-load" onto the device via the web interface. Either of those will be okay because it's still as good as plug and play; there's no reconfiguration or recompilation to do in the final/end-user versions!

Of course developers want the source code anyway, as this is an SDK not just a set of sample applications. But we will provide an easy way to install the applications stand-alone too. For example they could be very useful for hardware tests and diagnostics because they are much easier to use than the orignal Linux tools.

Links to download the development tools and basic instructions what to install are provided by Microsoft here:
